# Prompt Foundry: Application and Infrastructure Generation Project

This repository contains a key notebook, `Prompt_Foundry_New_Demo.ipynb`, as part of the broader **Prompt Foundry** project. The goal of this project is to create an end-to-end application that automates the deployment of full-stack applications to the cloud.

## Overview

The Prompt Foundry project leverages advanced AI techniques to ingest user specifications and generate ready-to-deploy code for applications. This includes both the application logic and its corresponding cloud infrastructure setup. The notebook in this repository demonstrates the core functionality of this automation.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Code Generation**: Uses OpenAI's API to synthesize application code based on user input.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Generates cloud deployment scripts for platforms like Azure.
- **Node.js Integration**: Produces application code in Node.js to ensure scalability and compatibility.
- **PDF Ingestion**: Reads and processes specifications from PDF documents to tailor code generation.
- **Seamless Deployment**: Ensures generated code is optimized for immediate deployment.

## File Structure

- `Prompt_Foundry_New_Demo.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook demonstrating the step-by-step implementation of the application and infrastructure generation pipeline.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
2. **Run the Notebook**:
   Open the notebook using Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Prompt_Foundry_New_Demo.ipynb
   ```
3. **Generate Code and Infrastructure**:
   Follow the instructions in the notebook to input your specifications and generate code and deployment scripts.

## Applications

This project is ideal for scenarios where rapid prototyping and deployment of applications are required. Potential use cases include:

- Building and deploying MVPs.
- Automating infrastructure setup for scalable cloud applications.
- Generating customized application logic from detailed specifications.
